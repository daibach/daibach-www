We&#8217;ve also said goodbye to some others &#8211; Andy, Lindsey, Sam and Mark. There&#8217;s been lots of noise about what this means for GDS, for ongoing digital transformation, for the [&#8230;]</p>

      <p>Last week I spent a day in Manchester with my team&#8217;s user researcher. She&#8217;s visiting people all over the country to help us better understand how people interact with government services. Taking part in research like this gives you a great opportunity to meet people outside of your normal circle. As a civil servant, I [&#8230;]</p>
