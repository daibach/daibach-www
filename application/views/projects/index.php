      <p>In 2011 I was a coding mentor for Young Rewired State at the Cardiff centre. The team built a HTML5 web app to display food hygiene ratings of restaurants, schools, hospitals and shops using geo-location, maps and data scraped from the Food Standards Agency.</p>
      <p>The app won an award for the best use of government data following the demonstrations at the end of the event.</p>

      <p>Spending Tweets was developed during a 4 hour coding challenge for <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a>. The aim of the project was to produce a twitter bot that would respond to queries from users with information about local authority spending.</p>
      <p>This service uses open data provided by <a href="http://www.openlylocal.com">Openly Local</a> and the Twitter/Bit.ly APIs to listen and respond to user's tweets.</p>

      <p>WhatTheyClaimed was developed as a crowd-sourcing attempt at processing MP expenses when the data was released in June 2009. The site allowed users to add in details of their MPs claims (taken from PDF documents) which would then be available online through an online interface and API.</p>
