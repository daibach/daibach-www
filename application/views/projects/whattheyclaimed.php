    <p>WhatTheyClaimed was developed as a crowd-sourcing attempt at processing MP expenses details when the original data was released in June 2009.</p>

    <p>The original, heavily redacted, MP expenses data was released as a series of scanned in PDF documents.  This app (which was originally built for storing expenses at CF Labs) allowed users to submit the details of individual claims to attempt to build up a full picture of all expense claims.</p>

    <p>The app was written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework and made use of Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/chart/image/">chart API</a> to provide visualisations of claims. More details about WhatTheyClaimed and how it worked are available on my blog (links below).</p>

    <p>The app was closed after several weeks and eventually taken offline in February 2009 after the data contained became stale and out-of-date following the release of cleaner copies.</p>
