<p>I coach and advise C-suite level executives, ministers, senior civil servants and CDO/CTOs on building digital capability, setting vision/strategy and leading complex transformation programmes.</p>

<p>I was a co-founder at the UK <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk">Government Digital Service</a> and I’ve supported the creation of digital services units around the world, including the <a href="https://medium.com/digital-services-nova-scotia/a-digital-service-for-nova-scotia-6e61c45e1f2e">Nova Scotia Digital Service</a> and the <a href="https://news.alpha.ca.gov/re-imagining-ca-gov-how-can-california-government-better-serve-its-people/">State of California Alpha</a> team.</p>

<p>I've helped organisations such as the Ministry of Justice manage the growing problem of unsustainable and complex legacy technology. I developed the strategy and led the teams to modernise and move the systems supporting Legal Aid to public cloud.</p>
