<h2>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h2>
<p>I use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. I do this to help me make sure the site works as expected and where I can make things better.</p>
<p>Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. I do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) in these analytics so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. I do not allow Google to use or share my analytics data.</p>
<p>The following cookies are set by Google Analytics:</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Expires</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>_ga</td>
      <td>This helps me count how many people visit my site by tracking if youâ€™ve visited before</td>
      <td>2 years</td>
